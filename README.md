## Using Quorum Wizard

Quorum Wizard is written in Javascript and designed to be run as a global NPM module from the command line. Make sure you have [Node.js/NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed.

Using npx to run the wizard without the need to install:

```
npx quorum-wizard
```

You can also install the wizard globally with npm:

```Bash
npm install -g quorum-wizard

# Once the global module is installed, run:
quorum-wizard
```

Note: Many installations of npm don't have permission to install global modules and will throw an EACCES error. [Here is the recommended solution from NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)

## Dependencies

Here are the dependencies (in addition to NodeJS) that are required depending on the mode that you run the wizard in:

Bash:
- Java (when running Tessera and/or Cakeshop)

Docker Compose:
- Docker
- docker-compose

Kubernetes:
- Docker (for generating resources during network creation)
- kubectl
- minikube

## Options

You can also provide these flags when running quorum-wizard:

| Flags | Effect |
| - | - |
| `-q`, `--quickstart` | Create 3 node raft network with tessera and cakeshop (no user-input required) |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Turn on additional logs for debugging |
